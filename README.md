# DataSciencePortfolioProject-CompaniesHouseData
A data analyst/science portfolio project using the data from the UK governments Companies House API. The first of the four phases has now been complete. See the project [wiki](https://github.com/AlanFrancisKirby/DataSciencePortfolioProject-CompaniesHouseData/wiki) for the software requirements specification and the project road map. <br><br>

A summary of the projects current state can be found in video format within the next section, with a video summary of the key next steps following thereafter. Please see the subsequent sections of this README file for information on using this project, reporting issues and giving feedback.<br><br>


-**~~Phase 1:~~** This involved setting up the data pipeline and basic data visualisations within PowerBI. The more sophisticated data science analysis is left for phase 2. <br><br>
-**Phase 2:** This will include taking the Python code that interacts with the Companies House API and Amazon AWS database and making it available to a non-technical user through a web-based GUI. Larger scale data collection will also be performed, as the small sample collected thus far is not representative of the UK economy. Once these steps have been complete, phase 2 will then include performing more sophisticated data science analysis. <br><br>
-**Phase 3:** This will include combining the companies house data with other sources of data to look for relationships between local business activity and other interesting metrics such as those relating to the health of the local population, connectivity with other major population centres, population demographics, and many other metrics. <br><br>
-**Phase 4:** This will include doing an in-depth analysis of specific locations and comparing their metrics to those of the national average, local average (for example Liverpool vs the North West of England), and to their neighbouring cities and towns. Interesting relationships and a historical summary for that location will be written up with the aim of contributing to a small local magazine, elucidating the details of the local economy and how it has developed over time.
