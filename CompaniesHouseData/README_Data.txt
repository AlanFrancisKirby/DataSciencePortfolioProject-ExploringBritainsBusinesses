This file contains labels for the various data files contained within the CompaniesHouseData folder.

1)
.profilerDataAllLocations_SampleData - The first sample data run for use by PowerBI.

2)
profilerDataSouthport - A full data run for Southport. The success rate at the time of gathering was
                        about 50% due to the XML file issue (see issue #5 in the projects GitHub
                        issue tracker). Thus not all of the Southport data has been returned.
